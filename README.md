* Getting the list of messages for You + people you follow is tricky'ish. Think of it like this:

```c#
  List<Post> GetTimeLine()
  {  
	var followerIds = db.Following.Where(f=>f.FollowedById == MyUserId).Select(f=>f.Userid);
    var allIds = followerIds.Add(MyUserId);
    return db.Posts.Where(x=> allIds.Contains(x.PostedById)).OrderByDesc(x=>x.CreatedBy);
 }
```
